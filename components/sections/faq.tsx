    answer: 'Most publishers go live in under 10 minutes. Our SDK is designed for simplicity with just a few lines of code to integrate.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can we control which advertisers appear?',
    answer: 'Yes. You have full control over which advertisers and categories appear in your app. You can block specific advertisers or entire categories through your dashboard.'
  },
  {
    question: 'When are payouts made?',
    answer: 'Payouts are issued monthly on Net-30 terms. All metrics shown in your dashboard reflect validated impressions and clicks.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How does Kovio decide which ads to display?',
    answer: 'We use advanced AI models to analyze user context and intent in real-time. Ads are matched based on relevance, ensuring users see contextual content that adds value to their conversation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Will ads slow down my AI responses?',
    answer: 'No. Our ad serving infrastructure operates in milliseconds with zero impact on your LLM response times. Ads are fetched asynchronously and rendered seamlessly.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What kind of revenue can I expect?',
    answer: 'Revenue varies based on traffic volume, user engagement, and content category. On average, our partners see 40-120% increase in monthly revenue with high user retention rates.'
